# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model - Development Stages  

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification, following a structured approach to **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Data Collection & Exploration**  
### **Stage Overview:**  
- The dataset was loaded using `pandas`.  
- Basic exploration was conducted, including checking for missing values, data types, and class distributions.  
- **Visualization** was performed using histograms, pair plots, and scatter plots to understand feature relationships.  

### **Key Steps:**  
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")
print(df.info())  # Checking data types and missing values
print(df.describe())  # Summary statistics

sns.pairplot(df, hue='target')  # Visualizing class distribution
plt.show()
