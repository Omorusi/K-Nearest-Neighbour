# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model - Development Stages  

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification, following a structured approach to **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization**.

## **1️⃣ Data Collection & Exploration**  
### **Stage Overview:**  
- The dataset was loaded using `pandas`.  
- Basic exploration was conducted, including checking for missing values, data types, and class distributions.  
- **Visualization** was performed using histograms, pair plots, and scatter plots to understand feature relationships.  

### **Key Steps:**  
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('/content/diabetes.csv',header=None)
data.head()

data.columns = ['Pregnancies','Glucose','BloodPressure','SkinThickness','Insulin','BMI','DiabetesPedigreeFunction','Age','Outcome']
data.head()
